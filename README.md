Tic-Tac-Toe using C# language. 
This game can be played in 2 ways: Player vs Player or Player vs Computer. In the latter way, you can choose 3 level: easy, normal or hard. Easy level will only make the machine write on the first empty position of the matrix. Normal level will make the machine write in random positions. Hard level will use a simple AI to analyze the best position to win or avoid losing according to the game's rules.

The machine will always write an 'O' and the player 'X'. After each move the code will check if any player has won.
